\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classLight}{Light}} \\*\mbox{[}\mbox{\hyperlink{classLight}{Light}}\mbox{]} class of the light (inherits from \mbox{\hyperlink{classRaySetting}{Ray\+Setting}}) This class is used to define the light and to define the methods that the light must have (ex\+: addition, subtraction, ...) }{\pageref{classLight}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classPlane}{Plane}} \\*\mbox{[}\mbox{\hyperlink{classPlane}{Plane}}\mbox{]} class of the plane primitive (inherits from \mbox{\hyperlink{classIprimitives}{Iprimitives}}) This class is used to define the plane primitive and to define the methods that the plane must have (ex\+: intersect, ...) }{\pageref{classPlane}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classRay}{Ray}} \\*\mbox{[}\mbox{\hyperlink{classRay}{Ray}}\mbox{]} Class of \mbox{\hyperlink{classRay}{Ray}} (used to define a ray) A ray is defined by an origin and a direction (ex\+: (0, 0, 0) and (1, 0, 0)) The ray is used to check if there is an intersection between the ray and the scene (ex\+: if there is an intersection between the ray and a sphere) The ray is also used to check if there is an intersection between the ray and the light (ex\+: if there is an intersection between the ray and the light, the point is in the shadow) The ray is also used to check if there is an intersection between the ray and the camera (ex\+: if there is an intersection between the ray and the camera, the point is visible) The ray is also used to check if there is an intersection between the ray and all the objects in the scene (ex\+: if there is an intersection between the ray and a sphere, the point is visible) }{\pageref{classRay}}{}
